This first iteration, written in Korn shell, was featured in a column by Becca Thomas in UnixWorld . shuffle was written using the MKS Toolkit, a Unix shell environment, running on DOS 3.3. in 2006 as shawkle . This second iteration, written in Bash shell, improved on shuffle by using awk for field-based pattern matching (hence the name shawkle ). It was featured in lifehacker.com with an introduction by Gina Trapani. starting in 2011, as shuffle.py . This was a re-implementation of the shawkle idea in Python, undertaken in large part as a way to teach myself Python. This iteration, which introduced the idea of automating the movement of list items between folders, was much faster than the older shell scripts, and it became stable and reliable enough to use almost every day from 2011 through 2019. The idea of undertaking yet another iteration, under the name mklists , with a proper test suite and documentation, was inspired by reading David Copeland's excellent book, Build Awesome Command-Line Applications in Ruby (https://pragprog.com/book/dccar/build-awesome-command-line-applications-in-ruby) in 2012. After learning Ruby and working for awhile on mklists.rb , I archived the unfinished Ruby implementation in early 2017, switched back to Python, and re-started this Github repository .","title":"History"}]}
