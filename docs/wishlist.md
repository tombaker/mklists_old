Wish list for mklists
---------------------

Some things I want to improve in the mklists iteration of the program:

* Unit tests (most of the code is about testing data integrity anyway) - will start with these
* Configuration file in YAML
* Default configuration file (./.mklistsrc) to be generated when program first run in a directory
* Per-directory configuration not just of rules, but of all options (over-rideable with command-line switches)
* Sensible defaults based on years of experience using previous iterations of the program
* Object-oriented design, if only as a learning exercise -- or is this overkill?
* Display process information at various levels of verbosity, or optionally write out event log
* Create a Python distribution package
* Well-managed Github repository, using the issue tracker, to encourage collaboration
* Good documentation, including a YouTube video
