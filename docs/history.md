The [mklists project](http://github.com/tombaker/mklists) aims at implementing the latest iteration of a script that I first developed in Korn shell in 1993. Some milestones:

* Publication in 1994 in a [column by Becca Thomas in UnixWorld](http://web.archive.org/web/20080513171823/http://web.bilkent.edu.tr/Online/uworld/archives/94/grabbag/06.txt.html) as [`shuffle`](http://web.archive.org/web/20080807155330/http://web.bilkent.edu.tr/Online/uworld/archives/94/grabbag/06.lst.html#L1A).  This first iteration was written in Korn shell using the MKS Toolkit, a Unix shell environment that ran on DOS 3.3.
* Publication in 2006 in a [column by Gina Trapani in lifehacker.com]( http://lifehacker.com/217063/getting-things-done-with-rule+based-list-processing ) as `shawkle`.  This second iteration, written in Bash shell, improved on `shuffle` by using `awk` for field-based pattern matching (hence the name `shawkle`).
* Development in 2011 of a Python script, first called `shawkle.py` and then [`shuffle.py`]( https://github.com/tombaker/shawkle/blob/master/shuffle.py ).  This re-implementation, undertaken as a way to teach myself Python, introduced the idea of automating the movement of list items between folders, was much faster than the older shell scripts, and it became stable and reliable enough to use almost every day from 2011 through 2019.
* Occasional work between 2012 and 2013 on a new Python implementation under the name `mklists`.  This version was [registered with pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/mklists/) in 2013.
* Shift of attention between 2014 and 2017 to a Ruby implementation, `mklists.rb`. The idea of re-implementing the script with a proper test suite and documentation was inspired by reading David Copeland's excellent book, [_Build Awesome Command-Line Applications in Ruby_](https://pragprog.com/book/dccar/build-awesome-command-line-applications-in-ruby).  
* Shift of attention in 2017 back to Python, with a [new Github repository](https://github.com/tombaker/mklists); see my [project goals as of June 2017](https://github.com/tombaker/mklists/blob/a800c6b5a6e46c523c4ccaf7fb16a50b9c4115c0/docs/wishlist.md).

In June 2017, I discovered the excellent (and fortuitously named) static site generator [`Mkdocs`](https://www.mkdocs.org), which I am using to generate this documentation website and which has inspired several features of `mklists`, such as the naming of the configuration file `mklists.yml` (analogously to `mkdocs.yml`).
