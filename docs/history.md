The [Mklists Project](http://github.com/tombaker/mklists) is re-implementing a
script previously known as
[`shuffle`](http://web.archive.org/web/20080513171823/http://web.bilkent.edu.tr/Online/uworld/archives/94/grabbag/06.txt.html),
which was featured in a column by Becca Thomas in UnixWorld in 1994;
[`shawkle`](http://lifehacker.com/217063/getting-things-done-with-rule+based-list-processing),
which was featured in 2006 with an introduction by Gina Trapani; and
[`shawkle.py`](https://github.com/tombaker/shawkle/blob/master/shawkle.py)
(Python, 2011), under the name mklists.py.

I have been using `shuffle` or `shawkle` in these various incarnations on a daily
basis, often dozens of times per day, since 1993.  The version that I currently
use, which (perhaps confusingly) is called
[`shuffle.py`](https://github.com/tombaker/shawkle/blob/master/shuffle.py),
occasionally gets updated with small changes.

Reading David Copeland's _Build Awesome Command-Line Applications in Ruby_ in
2012 inspired me to re-implement `shuffle.py` as `mklists`. After learning Ruby
and trying for awhile to implement the script in Ruby (`mklists.rb`), I started
a `mklists` repo on Github for a version in in Ruby.  Deleted the Ruby repo in
xxx, restarted as Python project. Got cluttered. Restarted in June 2017 as
Python project with nice documentation pages using the fortuitously named
static site generator [`MkDocs`](https://github.com).
