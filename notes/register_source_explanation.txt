        When class is first created, class variables 'initialized' 
        (a flag) and 'sources' (a list) are initialized.

        Note that every time I edit then execute the module, the 
        registry of sources is wiped clean.

        When Rule instantiated for first time: 
        * value of self.target added to 'sources' list
        * value of self.source _also_ added to 'sources' list 
        * 'initialized' flag is set to True

        When Rule is instantiated each subsequent time
        * iff value of self.source is in 'sources' list
          * value of self.target added to 'sources' list
        * iff value of self.source is _not_ in 'sources' list
          * exit with error message
