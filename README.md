mklists

Sync plain-text todo lists to evolving rules


Next steps:
* http://click.pocoo.org/6/utils/ - Click testing and file system isolation!!
* http://mklists.org/wishlist/ - compare to (delete someday)
* Update pip distribution

Maybe someday:
* Event logging?
* '--verify': Compare hash of data, before and after (really necessary?)
  * Function expects to be called twice, using 'yield' in non-iterative way?
* Add stringrule as Rule attribute so that error message can show what to edit
  * Maybe even with filename and line number? (really necessary?)
